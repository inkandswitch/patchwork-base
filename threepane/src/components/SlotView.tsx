 * document. A `[toolId, docId]` tuple renders that tool against the doc the
 * tuple itself names — each slot carries its own document.
 *
 * The tuple-vs-string check is a reactive `<Show>` rather than a plain ternary:
 * a slot can flip kind in place (e.g. a migrated `[toolId, docid]` tuple
 * rewritten to a bare component string) while this component stays mounted, and
 * a ternary — evaluated once when the component runs — would freeze on the stale
 * branch and index the string as if it were a tuple. Discriminate by
 * `Array.isArray`, not `typeof`: a raw-string slot can arrive as an Automerge
 * `RawString` object, which `typeof` would wrongly route to the tuple branch.
